This basic portfolio organizes and links to the work I've done so far in the Berkeley Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  This page will be updated regularly as I work thorugh the course material.





## Learning Points 

I'm aware of the vastness of what I don't know, however in the past week I've:
* Increased my functional knowledge of Git from zero to:
    * being able to comfortably navigate git bash for the few commands I need
    * having a basic understanding of how repos map to each other via git
    * perform all necessary functions to pull, add, commit and push code
    * avoid panic and know that no matter how opaque a problem seems, there is a solution out there that I can find
* I've become acquainted with the basic building blocks of html and css
* I've achieved a basic level of comfort using VS Code, github, gitlab, and the Bootcamp Spot site
* I've built a basic but functional workflow using the above tools
